Straightforward review/rating functionality.

## Installation

#### Spree >= 4.0

```ruby
gem 'spree_reviews', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_reviews'
```

#### Spree 3.0 and Spree 2.x

```ruby
 gem 'spree_reviews', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_reviews', branch: 'X-X-stable'
 ```

 The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
 For example, use `3-0-stable` if you're using Spree `3-0-stable` or any `3.0.x` version.

Now bundle up with:

    bundle

Next, run the rake task that copies the necessary migrations and assets to your project:

    bundle exec rails g spree_reviews:install

And finish with a migrate:

    bundle exec rake db:migrate

Now you should be able to boot up your server with:

    bundle exec rails s

That's all!

Users must be logged in to submit a review

 - `app/views/spree/products/_shortrating.html.erb` -- shorter version of above
 - `app/views/spree/products/_review.html.erb` -- display a single review

Administrator can edit and/or approve and/or delete reviews.

## Implementation

Reviews table is quite obvious - and note the "approved" flag which is for the
administrator to update.

Ratings table holds current fractional value - avoids frequent recalc...

## Discussion

Some points which might need modification in future:

 - I don't track the actual user on a review (just their "screen name" at the
   time), but we may want to use this information to avoid duplicate reviews
   etc. See https://github.com/spree/spree_reviews/issues/18
 - Rating votes are tied to a review, to avoid spam. However: ratings are
   accepted whether or not the review is accepted. Perhaps they should only
   be counted when the review is approved.
